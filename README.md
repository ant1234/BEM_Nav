## Rules for the test
- You need to match the rendering of the page to img/NavTestOutcome1.png
- Create your own HTML page called index.html to reflect the markup that will be required to create the navigation
- You will only be allowed to style classes and not elements
- Ensure you use a BEM strategy for your classes - [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
- *Each* top level of navigation must have 3 levels of markup beneath it with only the active level displaying children
- Be sure to show the active pathway as per the image
- All CSS must go in css/project.css
- We have started you off with some normalisation: main.css and normalize.css must be included in your html file
- The fonts required are Arial and Monserrat. Monserrat can be loaded from Google
- The results should be pixel perfect in Chrome only
- CSS must be vanilla (not sass or less)
- All rules are in px
